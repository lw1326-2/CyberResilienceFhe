# CyberResilienceFhe

A privacy-preserving platform for assessing the cyber resilience of financial systems using Fully Homomorphic Encryption (FHE). This platform allows regulatory bodies to securely analyze encrypted cybersecurity exercise data from multiple financial institutions, enabling comprehensive risk evaluation while protecting sensitive corporate information.

## Project Background

Assessing cyber resilience in the financial sector is challenging due to:

- **Data sensitivity**: Security exercise results contain confidential network configurations and vulnerabilities.  
- **Cross-institutional collaboration**: Regulatory oversight requires aggregation of data across banks without exposing proprietary details.  
- **Systemic risk analysis**: Identifying sector-wide threats demands advanced computation over sensitive data.  
- **Privacy and compliance**: Legal and regulatory constraints prevent sharing raw cybersecurity data.

CyberResilienceFhe addresses these challenges by:

- Encrypting institution-level security exercise data using FHE  
- Performing joint computations on encrypted data to evaluate systemic cyber resilience  
- Preserving institutional confidentiality while enabling regulatory insight  
- Generating actionable recommendations without exposing underlying data

## Features

### Core Functionality

- **Encrypted Data Collection**: Financial institutions submit encrypted cybersecurity exercise data.  
- **FHE-Based Analysis**: Evaluate system resilience, identify vulnerabilities, and simulate attack scenarios on encrypted inputs.  
- **Sector-Wide Aggregation**: Combine encrypted datasets from multiple institutions for comprehensive analysis.  
- **Automated Risk Scoring**: Compute resilience scores and highlight critical vulnerabilities while maintaining confidentiality.  
- **Visualization Dashboard**: Regulatory bodies view anonymized insights, trends, and risk alerts.

### Privacy & Security

- **Client-Side Encryption**: All institution data encrypted before transmission.  
- **FHE Computation**: Analysis occurs entirely on encrypted data, preventing exposure.  
- **Immutable Audit Trail**: Exercise submissions and results are securely logged.  
- **Institutional Anonymity**: Proprietary information is never revealed to other institutions or external parties.  
- **Secure Reporting**: Aggregate metrics and visualizations provide insights without compromising data privacy.

## Architecture
